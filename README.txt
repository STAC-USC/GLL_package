To install the package:
(1) Download the source files.
(2) Run script 'start_graph_learning.m'

The demo script 'demo_animals.m' shows the usage of functions used to estimate three different types of graph Laplacian matrices discussed in [1].

Additional scripts and a more detailed description will be available soon.
